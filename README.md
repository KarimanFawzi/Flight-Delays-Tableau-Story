# Flight-Delays-Tableau-Story
This Project is a part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program.

I obtained my dataset of Flight delays from RITA website which contained information on flight delays and the performances. The link to download the dataset is,
https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp

I downloaded the data from January 2004 to December 2018. 

Before starting my visualizations, I spent a considerable time in understanding the variables of the dataset and its data types, and to be honest, there are some variables I couldnâ€™t figure out what they represent or in what units they are,  so I avoided using them. 

I started my exploration with one main simple question in mind, is it extreme weather conditions or security checks that causes the most delays?

From that simple question, I started exploring the data variation over time and experiment with other variables like airport and carrier variations.
